Input: integer value N
Output: Generates N random points in the unit squares, and the closest pairs

Interal2D
Input: int value N, min, max
Ouput: 
- generates N random 2D intervals whose width and height are uniformly distributed between min and max in the unit square.
- draw them and print number of pairs of intervals that intersect, number of intervals that are contained in one another
